[[A]] It involves encryption cracking algorithms [[/A]]
[[A]] It forces access through doors or windows [[/A]]
[[A]] It relies on wireless signal jamming [[/A]]
[[A]] It bypasses firewall restrictions [[/A]]
[[C]] It forces access through doors or windows [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is RFID cloning? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Sending fake emails with embedded links [[/A]]

[[A]] Making a duplicate of an RFID access badge [[/A]]
[[A]] Encrypting badge data for security [[/A]]
[[A]] Remotely disabling key fobs [[/A]]
[[C]] Making a duplicate of an RFID access badge [[/C]]

[[Q]] How easy is it to obtain RFID cloning equipment? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It requires government clearance [[/A]]
[[A]] Only law enforcement has access to it [[/A]]
[[A]] It can be purchased online for under $50 [[/A]]
[[A]] It needs to be custom-built by professionals [[/A]]
[[A]] It’s only sold in security conferences [[/A]]
[[C]] It can be purchased online for under $50 [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why is multi-factor authentication helpful against RFID cloning? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It encrypts RFID signals before transmission [[/A]]
[[A]] It disables cloned cards automatically [[/A]]
[[A]] It prevents badge wear and tear [[/A]]
[[A]] It adds extra verification like PINs or biometrics [[/A]]
[[A]] It increases door lock strength [[/A]]
[[C]] It adds extra verification like PINs or biometrics [[/C]]

[[Q]] How can attackers clone an RFID card in public spaces? [[/Q]]
[[A]] By intercepting Wi-Fi signals from the victim [[/A]]
[[A]] By physically removing the card from a wallet [[/A]]
[[A]] By using a reader to brush near the victim [[/A]]
[[A]] By scanning a barcode off the card [[/A]]
[[A]] By photographing the access panel [[/A]]
[[C]] By using a reader to brush near the victim [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is an example of an environmental attack on a data center? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Cracking login credentials [[/A]]
[[A]] Turning off external lighting [[/A]]
[[A]] Disabling internet routers [[/A]]
[[A]] Cutting power from outside the building [[/A]]
[[A]] Sending malware via email [[/A]]
[[C]] Cutting power from outside the building [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why are HVAC systems considered a weak point in security? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They require frequent patching [[/A]]
[[A]] They often lack strong security controls [[/A]]
[[A]] They are connected to email servers [[/A]]
[[A]] They store user passwords [[/A]]
[[A]] They run the facility’s Wi-Fi [[/A]]
[[C]] They often lack strong security controls [[/C]]

[[Q]] What could happen if an attacker disables a data center’s cooling system? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It will redirect network traffic [[/A]]
[[A]] Systems may shut down from overheating [[/A]]
[[A]] All passwords will be reset [[/A]]
[[A]] Backup power will activate automatically [[/A]]
[[A]] The building’s lights will turn off [[/A]]
[[C]] Systems may shut down from overheating [[/C]]

[[Q]] How might a fire suppression system be exploited in an environmental attack? [[/Q]]
[[A]] By deleting system backups [[/A]]
[[A]] By initiating a denial of service [[/A]]
[[A]] By locking all server racks [[/A]]
[[A]] By flooding the server room with water [[/A]]
[[A]] By disabling employee key cards [[/A]]
