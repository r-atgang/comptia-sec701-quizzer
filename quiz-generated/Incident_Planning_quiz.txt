[[A]] Conducting code reviews [[/A]]
[[A]] Deploying new hardware updates [[/A]]
[[C]] Sending phishing emails to employees to test their responses [[/C]]

[[Q]] What should be evaluated if users click on phishing simulation links? [[/Q]]

[[A]] The number of hours they work per week [[/A]]
[[A]] The effectiveness of training and email filtering systems [[/A]]
[[A]] Whether they have antivirus installed [[/A]]
[[A]] Their login history [[/A]]
[[C]] The effectiveness of training and email filtering systems [[/C]]

[[Q]] How can third-party phishing simulations help organizations? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They bypass internal security controls [[/A]]
[[A]] They help promote third-party software solutions [[/A]]
[[A]] They test internal defenses and automated email filters [[/A]]
[[A]] They are required by all compliance standards [[/A]]
[[A]] They test password strength automatically [[/A]]
[[C]] They test internal defenses and automated email filters [[/C]]

[[Q]] What does root cause analysis aim to identify in a security incident? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The last system accessed by the attacker [[/A]]
[[A]] The total cost of the breach [[/A]]
[[A]] How an attacker initially gained access to the system [[/A]]
[[A]] The number of users online during the attack [[/A]]
[[A]] The best recovery tools available [[/A]]
[[C]] How an attacker initially gained access to the system [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which of the following tools is commonly used to perform root cause analysis? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Firewall rulebooks [[/A]]
[[A]] Server inventory lists [[/A]]
[[A]] Physical access logs [[/A]]
[[A]] Log files and attacker data on servers [[/A]]
[[A]] Organizational charts [[/A]]
[[C]] Log files and attacker data on servers [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why might there be more than one root cause in a security incident? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Because attackers often act alone [[/A]]
[[A]] Because systems are backed up multiple times [[/A]]
[[A]] Because multiple vulnerabilities or errors may contribute to the breach [[/A]]
[[A]] Because logs are not always accurate [[/A]]
[[A]] Because attackers erase all digital traces [[/A]]
[[C]] Because multiple vulnerabilities or errors may contribute to the breach [[/C]]

[[Q]] How can user mistakes contribute to a security incident? [[/Q]]
[[A]] By improving login accuracy [[/A]]
[[A]] By accelerating software patches [[/A]]
[[A]] By unintentionally giving attackers access through social engineering [[/A]]
[[A]] By increasing system bandwidth [[/A]]
