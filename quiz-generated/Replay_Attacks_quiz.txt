[[A]] Using the same hash repeatedly during authentication [[/A]]
[[C]] Encrypting the traffic and salting the password hash [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the role of a session ID in a session hijacking attack? [[/Q]]

[[A]] It identifies a user session and can be reused by an attacker to gain access [[/A]]
[[A]] It checks for malware on the client device [[/A]]
[[A]] It logs all DNS requests made by a browser [[/A]]

[[Q]] Why are browser cookies valuable to attackers? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They contain malware that can infect other systems [[/A]]
[[A]] They include executable code that can be reverse engineered [[/A]]
[[A]] They store session information that can allow access without credentials [[/A]]
[[A]] They automatically disable security tools [[/A]]
[[A]] They hold encryption keys used in HTTPS [[/A]]
[[C]] They store session information that can allow access without credentials [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a common method to capture session IDs or other header data? [[/Q]]

[[A]] Sending spam messages through email lists [[/A]]
[[A]] Deleting browser cache files [[/A]]
[[C]] Using tools like Wireshark or Kismet for packet capture [[/C]]

[[Q]] How can attackers exploit cross-site scripting (XSS) in relation to session hijacking? [[/Q]]
[[A]] To force a user to re-authenticate on the server [[/A]]
[[A]] To retrieve session IDs and send them to the attacker [[/A]]
[[A]] To change DNS settings on the client [[/A]]
[[A]] To block encryption protocols [[/A]]
[[A]] To erase cookies from the victim's browser [[/A]]
[[C]] To retrieve session IDs and send them to the attacker [[/C]]
