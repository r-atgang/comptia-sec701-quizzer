[[A]] They bypass multifactor authentication [[/A]]
[[A]] They store and encrypt multiple passwords securely [[/A]]
[[A]] They eliminate the need for user accounts [[/A]]
[[A]] They prevent brute force attacks [[/A]]
[[C]] They store and encrypt multiple passwords securely [[/C]]

[[Q]] How do password managers protect the information they store? [[/Q]]
[[A]] By saving it in plain text [[/A]]
[[A]] Through frequent password changes [[/A]]
[[A]] By using firewalls [[/A]]
[[A]] By encrypting the stored data [[/A]]
[[A]] By disabling access after each use [[/A]]
[[C]] By encrypting the stored data [[/C]]

[[Q]] What feature in some password managers helps users create strong passwords? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Password reuse detection [[/A]]
[[A]] Secure session logging [[/A]]
[[A]] Built-in antivirus protection [[/A]]
[[A]] Automatic password generation [[/A]]
[[A]] Multi-device syncing [[/A]]
[[C]] Automatic password generation [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a significant risk when users reuse passwords across multiple sites? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It causes accounts to expire faster [[/A]]
[[A]] It delays login times [[/A]]
[[A]] It makes brute force attacks impossible [[/A]]
[[A]] It increases the likelihood of system crashes [[/A]]
[[A]] It allows attackers to access multiple accounts [[/A]]
[[C]] It allows attackers to access multiple accounts [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which of the following is an example of passwordless authentication? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Entering a 12-character password [[/A]]
[[A]] Using a password manager [[/A]]
[[A]] Unlocking a phone with face recognition [[/A]]
[[A]] Changing passwords every 30 days [[/A]]
[[A]] Using upper- and lowercase letters in a password [[/A]]
[[C]] Unlocking a phone with face recognition [[/C]]

[[Q]] What often accompanies passwordless authentication in many systems? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Mandatory password reuse [[/A]]
[[A]] A complete removal of security tokens [[/A]]
[[A]] Combination with a traditional password [[/A]]
[[A]] Limited access to files [[/A]]
[[A]] Daily password rotation [[/A]]
[[C]] Combination with a traditional password [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the purpose of just-in-time (JIT) permissions in IT environments? [[/Q]]
[[A]] To ensure users always have administrative rights [[/A]]
[[A]] To allow attackers limited access [[/A]]
[[A]] To give temporary administrative access when needed [[/A]]
[[A]] To allow faster password resets [[/A]]
[[A]] To enforce password reuse [[/A]]
[[C]] To give temporary administrative access when needed [[/C]]

[[Q]] What does the central clearinghouse do in the JIT process? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Automatically approves all access requests [[/A]]
[[A]] Stores backup files [[/A]]
[[A]] Provides long-term administrator credentials [[/A]]
[[A]] Grants or denies access based on security policies [[/A]]
[[A]] Logs users out after each session [[/A]]
[[C]] Grants or denies access based on security policies [[/C]]

[[Q]] How are temporary credentials assigned in just-in-time permissions? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Through biometric authentication [[/A]]
[[A]] Using primary credentials directly [[/A]]
[[A]] As permanent administrator accounts [[/A]]
[[A]] Based on historical login data [[/A]]
[[A]] Created from primary credentials and assigned ephemerally [[/A]]
[[C]] Created from primary credentials and assigned ephemerally [[/C]]
