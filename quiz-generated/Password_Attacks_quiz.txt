[[Q]] What is a hash often referred to as in cybersecurity? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Encryption key [[/A]]
[[A]] Firewall rule [[/A]]
[[A]] Message digest or fingerprint [[/A]]
[[A]] Authorization token [[/A]]
[[A]] Session cookie [[/A]]
[[C]] Message digest or fingerprint [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why is hashing a secure way to store passwords? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The hash changes daily [[/A]]
[[A]] It compresses the password [[/A]]
[[A]] The hash cannot be reversed to reveal the original password [[/A]]
[[A]] It adds symbols to the password [[/A]]
[[A]] The password is encrypted with a key [[/A]]
[[C]] The hash cannot be reversed to reveal the original password [[/C]]

[[Q]] What does the SHA-256 hashing algorithm demonstrate in the video example? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Similar passwords produce similar hashes [[/A]]
[[A]] A one-character change results in a completely different hash [[/A]]
[[A]] Passwords are encrypted, not hashed [[/A]]
[[A]] Hashes are readable only by the operating system [[/A]]
[[A]] SHA-256 is not commonly used [[/A]]
[[C]] A one-character change results in a completely different hash [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a password spraying attack? [[/Q]]
[[A]] An attack using malware to disable antivirus [[/A]]
[[A]] Repeated attempts using many password combinations on one account [[/A]]
[[A]] Using phishing emails to guess a password [[/A]]
[[A]] Trying common passwords across multiple accounts to avoid lockouts [[/A]]
[[A]] Exploiting biometric authentication systems [[/A]]
[[C]] Trying common passwords across multiple accounts to avoid lockouts [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why do attackers prefer password spraying over brute force online? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It uses fewer system resources [[/A]]
[[A]] It guarantees success [[/A]]
[[A]] It prevents detection by avoiding account lockouts [[/A]]
[[A]] It encrypts the password file [[/A]]
[[A]] It requires admin credentials [[/A]]
[[C]] It prevents detection by avoiding account lockouts [[/C]]

[[Q]] What are examples of common passwords often used in password spraying attacks? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Letmein, welcome1, and admin1234 [[/A]]
[[A]] 123456, qwerty, and password [[/A]]
[[A]] abc123, !@#$%, and P@ssw0rd [[/A]]
[[A]] Google123, Yahoo456, and Bing789 [[/A]]
[[A]] testpass, rootadmin, and 987654321 [[/A]]
[[C]] 123456, qwerty, and password [[/C]]

[[Q]] How does a brute force attack typically operate? [[/Q]]
[[A]] By phishing the user for their credentials [[/A]]
[[A]] By exploiting software vulnerabilities [[/A]]
[[A]] By attempting every possible password combination [[/A]]
[[A]] By using multiple login portals [[/A]]
[[A]] By disabling account lockout settings [[/A]]
[[C]] By attempting every possible password combination [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why do attackers prefer to perform brute force attacks offline? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It allows access to the user interface [[/A]]
[[A]] It avoids firewall logging [[/A]]
[[A]] It bypasses multi-factor authentication [[/A]]
[[A]] There are no lockouts, and they can try unlimited attempts [[/A]]
[[A]] It encrypts the password data automatically [[/A]]
[[C]] There are no lockouts, and they can try unlimited attempts [[/C]]

[[Q]] What information does a password hash file usually contain? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Plaintext passwords and home addresses [[/A]]
[[A]] Usernames, group IDs, and hashed passwords [[/A]]
[[A]] Credit card data and phone numbers [[/A]]
[[A]] Session tokens and cookies [[/A]]
[[A]] IP addresses and browser fingerprints [[/A]]
[[C]] Usernames, group IDs, and hashed passwords [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the challenge for attackers when passwords are long and hashed with strong algorithms? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They cannot export the hash [[/A]]
[[A]] The hash reveals the encryption key [[/A]]
[[A]] Brute forcing them takes significant time and resources [[/A]]
[[A]] The hashes canâ€™t be copied to a different system [[/A]]
[[A]] The operating system will detect the hash [[/A]]
[[C]] Brute forcing them takes significant time and resources [[/C]]
