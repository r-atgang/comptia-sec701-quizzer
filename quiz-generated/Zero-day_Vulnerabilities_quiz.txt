[[Q]] What defines a zero-day attack? [[/Q]]
[[A]] An attack that uses outdated patches [[/A]]
[[A]] An attack that only affects mobile devices [[/A]]
[[A]] An attack using known and documented vulnerabilities [[/A]]
[[A]] An attack that occurs before the vendor is aware of the vulnerability [[/A]]
[[A]] An attack that requires user permission to execute [[/A]]
[[C]] An attack that occurs before the vendor is aware of the vulnerability [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why are zero-day vulnerabilities particularly dangerous? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They are only found in outdated systems [[/A]]
[[A]] They are always spread via phishing emails [[/A]]
[[A]] There are no existing patches to mitigate them at the time of discovery [[/A]]
[[A]] They require administrative access to function [[/A]]
[[A]] They can only target mobile applications [[/A]]
[[C]] There are no existing patches to mitigate them at the time of discovery [[/C]]

[[Q]] Who are the typical groups trying to discover vulnerabilities in systems and applications? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Vendors and end users [[/A]]
[[A]] Governments and software distributors [[/A]]
[[A]] Researchers and attackers [[/A]]
[[A]] Patch developers and IT administrators [[/A]]
[[A]] Hardware manufacturers and antivirus companies [[/A]]
[[C]] Researchers and attackers [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a major reason attackers do not report discovered vulnerabilities? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They want to sell the information to antivirus companies [[/A]]
[[A]] They are under legal obligation to remain silent [[/A]]
[[A]] They are working with software vendors directly [[/A]]
[[A]] They want to exploit the vulnerability before a patch is created [[/A]]
[[A]] They assume the vendor already knows about it [[/A]]
[[C]] They want to exploit the vulnerability before a patch is created [[/C]]

[[Q]] Where can someone find information about known vulnerabilities and zero-day attacks? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Microsoft Security Portal [[/A]]
[[A]] The OWASP Top Ten website [[/A]]
[[A]] The US-CERT notification system [[/A]]
[[A]] CVE.mitre.org [[/A]]
[[A]] NIST's firewall guidelines [[/A]]
[[C]] CVE.mitre.org [[/C]]

[[A]] Network credential theft [[/A]]
[[A]] Memory corruption and sandbox escape [[/A]]
[[A]] Bluetooth-based privilege escalation [[/A]]
[[A]] iCloud credential leaks [[/A]]

[[Q]] What problem was Microsoftâ€™s May 2023 zero-day patch designed to fix? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Weak encryption in Microsoft Edge [[/A]]
[[A]] Unauthorized access through OneDrive [[/A]]
[[A]] Code execution through phishing links [[/A]]
[[A]] Self-signed code running during UEFI boot despite secure boot [[/A]]
[[A]] Malware disguised as Windows updates [[/A]]
[[C]] Self-signed code running during UEFI boot despite secure boot [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which three zero-day issues did Apple patch in May 2023? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Rootkit injection, SQL injection, and SSL stripping [[/A]]
[[A]] DNS spoofing, spyware installation, and keystroke logging [[/A]]
[[A]] Sandbox escape, sensitive data disclosure, and arbitrary code execution [[/A]]
[[A]] Email spoofing, jailbreaking, and system rebooting [[/A]]
[[A]] App store tampering, file corruption, and memory overflow [[/A]]
[[C]] Sandbox escape, sensitive data disclosure, and arbitrary code execution [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why was it critical for companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google to release patches quickly in 2023? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The vulnerabilities were only affecting cloud services [[/A]]
[[A]] The attacks were hypothetical and not yet active [[/A]]
[[A]] Regulatory compliance demanded it immediately [[/A]]
[[A]] The exploits were already being used in the wild [[/A]]
[[A]] All users were notified in advance [[/A]]
[[C]] The exploits were already being used in the wild [[/C]]
