[[Q]] Which statement best describes application allow lists? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They allow any application to run unless explicitly denied [[/A]]
[[A]] They block only known malicious IP addresses [[/A]]
[[A]] They permit only approved applications to run [[/A]]
[[A]] They monitor CPU usage of each application [[/A]]
[[A]] They track file size changes in apps [[/A]]
[[C]] They permit only approved applications to run [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the difference between an allow list and a deny list? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Allow lists block malicious apps, deny lists approve them [[/A]]
[[A]] Allow lists let all apps run by default [[/A]]
[[A]] Deny lists allow only signed apps [[/A]]
[[A]] Allow lists block everything not explicitly approved, deny lists block only what’s listed [[/A]]
[[A]] Deny lists run faster than allow lists [[/A]]
[[C]] Allow lists block everything not explicitly approved, deny lists block only what’s listed [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is an example of a deny list in use? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Setting permissions in a file folder [[/A]]
[[A]] A digital signature verification tool [[/A]]
[[A]] An antivirus program blocking known malware [[/A]]

[[A]] Creating a firewall rule for specific IP ranges [[/A]]
[[C]] An antivirus program blocking known malware [[/C]]

[[Q]] How can an application be identified using a hash? [[/Q]]
[[A]] By its size in bytes [[/A]]
[[A]] By its installation date [[/A]]
[[A]] By a unique value representing the app’s exact contents [[/A]]
[[A]] By the name of the user who installed it [[/A]]
[[A]] By the port it uses [[/A]]
[[C]] By a unique value representing the app’s exact contents [[/C]]

[[Q]] What happens if a digitally signed application is from a trusted organization? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It gets automatically removed [[/A]]
[[A]] It is automatically blocked [[/A]]
[[A]] It is not subject to any rules [[/A]]
[[A]] It may be allowed based on the digital signature [[/A]]
[[A]] It replaces the existing ACL rules [[/A]]
[[C]] It may be allowed based on the digital signature [[/C]]
