[[Q]] Why might malware delete itself when executed inside a sandbox? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It detects limited network connectivity or virtualized hardware. [[/A]]
[[A]] The sandbox automatically patches the malware code. [[/A]]
[[A]] Sandboxes block all write access to disk. [[/A]]
[[A]] Sandboxes force the malware to run as a non-root user. [[/A]]
[[A]] Malware cannot allocate memory inside a sandbox. [[/A]]
[[C]] It detects limited network connectivity or virtualized hardware. [[/C]]

[[Q]] During the recovery phase, which action BEST ensures compromised system files are replaced with trusted versions? [[/Q]]

[[C]] Restoring from a known-good backup image [[/C]]

[[Q]] When should a post-incident meeting ideally take place? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Immediately after normal business hours on any day [[/A]]

[[A]] Only after legal counsel completes its investigation [[/A]]
[[A]] At the next quarterly security review [[/A]]
[[A]] After all affected users have changed their passwords [[/A]]
[[C]] As soon as possible once the incident is fully resolved [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which challenge makes security-incident detection difficult on Internet-connected networks? [[/Q]]

[[A]] Frequent hardware failures in perimeter devices [[/A]]
[[A]] Automatic OS updates masking file changes [[/A]]
[[A]] End-user encryption of personal data [[/A]]
