[[A]] They use an unsupported email format. [[/A]]
[[C]] They are spoofed and appear to come from someone familiar. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What does a mail gateway do with incoming emails? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Converts them to text format. [[/A]]
[[A]] Checks their source and determines whether to allow, block, or quarantine them. [[/A]]
[[A]] Automatically translates the message into multiple languages. [[/A]]
[[A]] Encrypts messages before delivery. [[/A]]
[[A]] Archives all messages for later retrieval. [[/A]]
[[C]] Checks their source and determines whether to allow, block, or quarantine them. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is SPF used for in email communication? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Encrypting messages during transmission. [[/A]]
[[A]] Identifying spam messages. [[/A]]
[[A]] Defining authorized email servers for a domain. [[/A]]
[[A]] Storing email backups. [[/A]]
[[A]] Compressing email attachments. [[/A]]
[[C]] Defining authorized email servers for a domain. [[/C]]

[[Q]] Where is SPF data stored for verification purposes? [[/Q]]
[[A]] On the sender's email client. [[/A]]
[[A]] In a web proxy cache. [[/A]]
[[A]] As a text record in DNS. [[/A]]
[[A]] Inside each email body. [[/A]]
[[A]] On a dedicated SPF server. [[/A]]
[[C]] As a text record in DNS. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What kind of information does a DNS TXT record contain for SPF? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The physical location of the mail server. [[/A]]
[[A]] A list of blacklisted IPs. [[/A]]
[[A]] A list of email addresses allowed to send email. [[/A]]
[[A]] The email content headers. [[/A]]
[[A]] Servers authorized to send mail for the domain. [[/A]]
[[C]] Servers authorized to send mail for the domain. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What role does DKIM play in email security? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Encrypts the email for recipient viewing only. [[/A]]
[[A]] Verifies the identity of the domain owner via public key infrastructure. [[/A]]
[[A]] Adds a digital signature to email headers for validation. [[/A]]
[[A]] Stores emails in a secure cloud vault. [[/A]]
[[A]] Automatically deletes spoofed emails. [[/A]]
[[C]] Adds a digital signature to email headers for validation. [[/C]]

[[Q]] How can receiving mail servers verify a DKIM signature? [[/Q]]
[[A]] By decrypting the message body. [[/A]]
[[A]] By comparing the sender's IP to a blacklist. [[/A]]
[[A]] By querying the sender’s DNS for the DKIM public key. [[/A]]
[[A]] By matching the message format against a template. [[/A]]
[[A]] By checking the email client used. [[/A]]
[[C]] By querying the sender’s DNS for the DKIM public key. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the relationship between SPF, DKIM, and DMARC? [[/Q]]
[[A]] DMARC acts as a replacement for SPF and DKIM. [[/A]]
[[A]] DMARC encrypts messages based on DKIM rules. [[/A]]
[[A]] DMARC extends and uses SPF and DKIM to validate email sources. [[/A]]
[[A]] SPF and DKIM are deprecated in favor of DMARC. [[/A]]
[[A]] DKIM and SPF run independently and are unrelated to DMARC. [[/A]]
[[C]] DMARC extends and uses SPF and DKIM to validate email sources. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What options does DMARC provide for handling unvalidated emails? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Rewrite the email sender name. [[/A]]
[[A]] Delay delivery until validated. [[/A]]
[[A]] Encrypt the email content. [[/A]]
[[A]] Accept, quarantine, or reject the email. [[/A]]
[[A]] Log the IP address of the recipient. [[/A]]
[[C]] Accept, quarantine, or reject the email. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What additional feature does DMARC support besides handling email disposition? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Automatic email forwarding. [[/A]]
[[A]] Generating compliance reports. [[/A]]
[[A]] Content scanning for malware. [[/A]]
[[A]] Changing DNS routing dynamically. [[/A]]
[[A]] Blocking outgoing emails. [[/A]]
[[C]] Generating compliance reports. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the benefit of DMARC reports for domain owners? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They help monitor domain DNS speed. [[/A]]
[[A]] They provide a record of email read receipts. [[/A]]
[[A]] They track how many messages validate and identify possible spoofing. [[/A]]
[[A]] They enable automatic email reply management. [[/A]]
[[A]] They backup all emails in real-time. [[/A]]
[[C]] They track how many messages validate and identify possible spoofing. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What kind of DNS record is used to implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC? [[/Q]]
[[A]] MX record [[/A]]
[[A]] A record [[/A]]
[[A]] PTR record [[/A]]
[[A]] TXT record [[/A]]
[[A]] CNAME record [[/A]]
[[C]] TXT record [[/C]]
