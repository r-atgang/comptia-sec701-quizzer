[[A]] To control who can access specific resources [[/A]]  
[[A]] To assign usernames and passwords [[/A]]  
[[A]] To schedule system maintenance [[/A]]  
[[A]] To monitor internet usage [[/A]]  
[[C]] To control who can access specific resources [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What function does accounting serve in the AAA model? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Provides encryption for transmitted data [[/A]]  
[[A]] Stores password hashes [[/A]]  
[[A]] Tracks user activity, such as login times and data usage [[/A]]  
[[A]] Issues new user credentials [[/A]]  
[[A]] Blocks unauthorized users [[/A]]  
[[C]] Tracks user activity, such as login times and data usage [[/C]]  

[[Q]] Where is authentication data typically stored in a network using AAA? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] On the user's local device [[/A]]  
[[A]] On the VPN concentrator [[/A]]  
[[A]] On a central AAA server [[/A]]  
[[A]] On the firewall [[/A]]  
[[A]] In a browser cache [[/A]]  
[[C]] On a central AAA server [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What role does the VPN concentrator play during the AAA process? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] It creates user certificates [[/A]]  
[[A]] It stores user passwords [[/A]]  
[[A]] It relays login credentials to the AAA server for verification [[/A]]  
[[A]] It restricts access to internet sites [[/A]]  
[[A]] It encrypts all outgoing emails [[/A]]  
[[C]] It relays login credentials to the AAA server for verification [[/C]]  

[[Q]] Why might certificates be used instead of passwords for device authentication? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Passwords are too expensive to manage [[/A]]  
[[A]] Devices can’t remember passwords [[/A]]  
[[A]] Certificates provide a more secure, verifiable identity [[/A]]  
[[A]] Certificates reduce battery consumption [[/A]]  
[[A]] Passwords can’t be encrypted [[/A]]  
[[C]] Certificates provide a more secure, verifiable identity [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What is required to create a device certificate for authentication purposes? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] DNS server [[/A]]  
[[A]] Authentication token [[/A]]  
[[A]] Certificate Authority (CA) [[/A]]  
[[A]] Root password [[/A]]  
[[A]] VPN concentrator [[/A]]  
[[C]] Certificate Authority (CA) [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What does a Certificate Authority (CA) do? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Creates and manages encryption keys [[/A]]  
[[A]] Monitors network traffic [[/A]]  
[[A]] Signs and manages digital certificates [[/A]]  
[[A]] Provides internet access to users [[/A]]  
[[A]] Logs software usage statistics [[/A]]  
[[C]] Signs and manages digital certificates [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What is the benefit of using an authorization model in large organizations? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] It reduces the need for authentication [[/A]]  
[[A]] It eliminates accounting requirements [[/A]]  
[[A]] It allows scalable and efficient access management [[/A]]  
[[A]] It replaces the need for digital certificates [[/A]]  
[[A]] It encrypts all network traffic [[/A]]  
[[C]] It allows scalable and efficient access management [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What is one major drawback of assigning rights and permissions manually for each user? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] It increases network bandwidth [[/A]]  
[[A]] It prevents users from logging in [[/A]]  
[[A]] It’s difficult to maintain and scale [[/A]]  
[[A]] It makes the network vulnerable to viruses [[/A]]  
[[A]] It disables group access [[/A]]  
[[C]] It’s difficult to maintain and scale [[/C]]  

[[Q]] How does using groups in an authorization model simplify access control? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] It automatically changes user passwords [[/A]]  
[[A]] It encrypts user data [[/A]]  
[[A]] It blocks unauthorized websites [[/A]]  
[[A]] It allows assigning permissions to multiple users at once [[/A]]  
[[A]] It generates usernames [[/A]]  
[[C]] It allows assigning permissions to multiple users at once [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What is the term for separating users from the resources they access in an authorization model? [[/Q]]
