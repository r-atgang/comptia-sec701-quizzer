[[A]] To prioritize vulnerabilities based on the number of users affected [[/A]]  
[[A]] To calculate the total number of vulnerabilities in an environment [[/A]]  
[[C]] To quantify the impact of a vulnerability in terms of system downtime [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What is the risk tolerance in vulnerability management? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] The time required to implement a vulnerability patch [[/A]]  
[[A]] The amount of risk an organization is willing to accept while unpatched vulnerabilities exist [[/A]]  
[[A]] The percentage of vulnerabilities that need to be patched immediately [[/A]]  
[[A]] The severity of the vulnerability based on its exploitability [[/A]]  
[[A]] The number of devices affected by a vulnerability [[/A]]  
[[C]] The amount of risk an organization is willing to accept while unpatched vulnerabilities exist [[/C]]  

[[Q]] How does the environment impact vulnerability patching? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Public cloud vulnerabilities should be patched before vulnerabilities in a test lab [[/A]]  
[[A]] Only critical vulnerabilities should be patched in a production environment [[/A]]  
[[A]] Test lab vulnerabilities should be patched at the same priority as production vulnerabilities [[/A]]  
[[A]] All vulnerabilities in any environment should be patched immediately [[/A]]  
[[A]] Patching is unnecessary in a private environment [[/A]]  
[[C]] Public cloud vulnerabilities should be patched before vulnerabilities in a test lab [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What factor should be considered when prioritizing vulnerabilities in an organization? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] The number of devices affected by the vulnerability [[/A]]  
[[A]] The criticality of the application or system affected [[/A]]  
[[A]] Whether the vulnerability is being actively exploited [[/A]]  
[[A]] The level of exposure to external attacks [[/A]]  
[[A]] All of the above [[/A]]
