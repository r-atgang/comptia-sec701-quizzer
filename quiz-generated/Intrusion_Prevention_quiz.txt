[[Q]] What is the primary function of an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)? [[/Q]]

[[Q]] How does an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) differ from an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)? [[/Q]]
[[A]] IDS blocks malicious traffic while IPS only alerts [[/A]]
[[A]] IDS encrypts traffic while IPS decrypts it [[/A]]
[[A]] IDS analyzes data offline, IPS works online [[/A]]
[[A]] IDS only alerts about threats but cannot block them [[/A]]
[[A]] IDS is used in cloud environments only [[/A]]
[[C]] IDS only alerts about threats but cannot block them [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a potential downside of placing a security device inline on a network? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It can increase bandwidth significantly [[/A]]
[[A]] It may fail and allow viruses through [[/A]]
[[A]] It might introduce latency during email transmissions [[/A]]
[[A]] If it fails, it may interrupt all network communication [[/A]]
[[A]] It automatically deletes critical logs [[/A]]
[[C]] If it fails, it may interrupt all network communication [[/C]]

[[Q]] What happens in a fail-open IPS configuration when the device fails? [[/Q]]
[[A]] All network traffic is encrypted [[/A]]
[[A]] The IPS blocks all traffic until restarted [[/A]]
[[A]] Network traffic continues to flow but without security inspection [[/A]]
[[A]] Traffic is rerouted through the firewall [[/A]]
[[A]] The device logs the failure and shuts down [[/A]]
[[C]] Network traffic continues to flow but without security inspection [[/C]]

[[Q]] In a fail-closed IPS configuration, what is the result of a device crash? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Only malicious traffic is blocked [[/A]]
[[A]] The IPS reboots automatically and restores traffic [[/A]]
[[A]] Traffic continues to flow but is not inspected [[/A]]
[[A]] Network communication stops entirely [[/A]]
[[A]] The IPS switches to a passive mode [[/A]]
[[C]] Network communication stops entirely [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why might an organization prefer a fail-open IPS over a fail-closed one? [[/Q]]
[[A]] To allow traffic even when the IPS is overloaded [[/A]]
[[A]] To prevent the IPS from logging data [[/A]]
[[A]] To ensure network uptime even if the IPS fails [[/A]]
[[A]] To allow encrypted traffic to bypass security checks [[/A]]
[[A]] To reduce memory usage on the firewall [[/A]]
[[C]] To ensure network uptime even if the IPS fails [[/C]]

[[Q]] What type of IPS deployment involves placing the IPS directly in the traffic path? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Passive deployment [[/A]]
[[A]] Offline configuration [[/A]]
[[A]] Bypass mode [[/A]]
[[A]] Inline deployment [[/A]]
[[A]] Cloud-based monitoring [[/A]]
[[C]] Inline deployment [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the main concern organizations have with active IPS monitoring? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It increases DNS lookup times [[/A]]
[[A]] It might cause application crashes [[/A]]
[[A]] It may block legitimate traffic or cause downtime [[/A]]
[[A]] It interferes with encrypted traffic [[/A]]
[[A]] It duplicates all traffic and increases load [[/A]]
[[C]] It may block legitimate traffic or cause downtime [[/C]]

[[Q]] What describes passive IPS monitoring? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The IPS blocks all incoming traffic [[/A]]
[[A]] The IPS modifies packets before forwarding [[/A]]
[[A]] The IPS is inline and filters all data [[/A]]
[[A]] The IPS receives a copy of traffic and analyzes it [[/A]]
[[A]] The IPS handles routing between subnets [[/A]]
[[C]] The IPS receives a copy of traffic and analyzes it [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a limitation of passive IPS monitoring? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It cannot analyze encrypted data [[/A]]
[[A]] It increases the risk of malware on endpoints [[/A]]
[[A]] It cannot block malicious traffic in real time [[/A]]
[[A]] It disables the firewall [[/A]]
[[A]] It automatically redirects traffic to the cloud [[/A]]
[[C]] It cannot block malicious traffic in real time [[/C]]

[[Q]] What tool can be used to duplicate traffic for a passive IPS? [[/Q]]
[[A]] NAT translation [[/A]]
[[A]] VPN concentrator [[/A]]
[[A]] DHCP relay [[/A]]
[[A]] Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN) [[/A]]
[[A]] QoS manager [[/A]]
[[C]] Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN) [[/C]]

[[Q]] How does a physical network tap assist passive IPS monitoring? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It compresses the traffic for faster inspection [[/A]]
[[A]] It encrypts duplicate packets [[/A]]
[[A]] It provides an alternative IP address to the IPS [[/A]]
[[A]] It creates a copy of traffic without disrupting the original flow [[/A]]
[[A]] It reconfigures the switch for inline analysis [[/A]]
[[C]] It creates a copy of traffic without disrupting the original flow [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why might a passive IPS configuration be referred to as an IDS design? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Because it uses the same hardware as an IDS [[/A]]
[[A]] Because it logs traffic data in the same format [[/A]]
[[A]] Because it cannot perform real-time traffic blocking [[/A]]
[[A]] Because it authenticates users using signatures [[/A]]
[[A]] Because it sits between the firewall and router [[/A]]
[[C]] Because it cannot perform real-time traffic blocking [[/C]]
