[[Q]] How does role-based access control (RBAC) assign permissions? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Based on time of day [[/A]]

[[Q]] In Windows systems, what is typically used to implement role-based access control? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Permissions files [[/A]]  
[[A]] Administrative prompts [[/A]]  
[[A]] Local user accounts [[/A]]  
[[A]] Groups [[/A]]

[[Q]] What defines permissions in a rule-based access control model? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Decisions made by individual users [[/A]]  
[[A]] User-selected browser types [[/A]]  
[[A]] Labels such as "confidential" or "top secret" [[/A]]  
[[A]] Rules set by the system administrator [[/A]]

[[C]] Rules set by the system administrator [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What is an example of a rule in rule-based access control? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Allowing all users to access the network at any time [[/A]]  
[[A]] Giving users access based on their group name [[/A]]  
[[A]] Only allowing access during business hours [[/A]]  
[[A]] Allowing users to choose their own restrictions [[/A]]  
[[A]] Assigning access levels through a vote [[/A]]  
[[C]] Only allowing access during business hours [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What makes attribute-based access control (ABAC) more flexible than other models? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] It only uses labels for classifying data [[/A]]  
[[A]] It relies entirely on user discretion [[/A]]  
[[A]] It uses a single rule for all users [[/A]]  
[[A]] It combines multiple criteria to determine access [[/A]]  
[[A]] It assigns access based only on file type [[/A]]  
[[C]] It combines multiple criteria to determine access [[/C]]  

[[Q]] Which of the following can be used as a criterion in attribute-based access control? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Type of file system [[/A]]  
[[A]] Userâ€™s screen resolution [[/A]]  
[[A]] IP address of the requestor [[/A]]  
[[A]] Manufacturer of the hard drive [[/A]]  
[[A]] Number of devices in the network [[/A]]  
[[C]] IP address of the requestor [[/C]]  

[[Q]] What is the purpose of a time-of-day restriction in access control? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] To limit user account creation to work hours [[/A]]  
[[A]] To disable internet access at night [[/A]]  
[[A]] To allow or block access to resources based on the current time [[/A]]  
[[A]] To synchronize file access logs [[/A]]  
[[A]] To enforce backup operations during business hours [[/A]]  
[[C]] To allow or block access to resources based on the current time [[/C]]  

[[Q]] Why might time zone be considered in time-of-day restrictions? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] To block access during software updates [[/A]]  
[[A]] Because all users should share a global clock [[/A]]  
[[A]] To ensure that restrictions align with local working hours [[/A]]  
[[A]] To maintain server uptime metrics [[/A]]  
[[A]] Because data access rules do not support hours [[/A]]
