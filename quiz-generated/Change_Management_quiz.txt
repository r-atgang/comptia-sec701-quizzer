[[A]] Training users on company policies [[/A]]  
[[A]] Safely testing changes without impacting production [[/A]]  
[[A]] Encrypting backup data for disaster recovery [[/A]]  
[[C]] Safely testing changes without impacting production [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is one reason a change might need a rollback or backout plan? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] To avoid licensing issues [[/A]]  
[[A]] Because changes can be irreversible [[/A]]  
[[A]] To ensure changes happen during business hours [[/A]]  
[[A]] To recover if the change causes a problem [[/A]]  
[[A]] To reduce the number of stakeholders involved [[/A]]

[[Q]] Why is having a backup before a change implemented important? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] To train new employees on system usage [[/A]]  
[[A]] To simplify the approval process [[/A]]  
[[A]] To comply with all vendor contracts [[/A]]  
[[A]] To restore the system if the change and rollback both fail [[/A]]  
[[A]] To avoid scheduling changes during off-hours [[/A]]  
[[C]] To restore the system if the change and rollback both fail [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why might changes be scheduled during off-hours? [[/Q]]  
[[A]] Because staff are more productive then [[/A]]  
[[A]] To reduce the risk of disrupting normal operations [[/A]]  
[[A]] Because updates are only available at night [[/A]]  
[[A]] To avoid power consumption issues [[/A]]  
[[A]] Because change control boards only meet at night [[/A]]  
[[C]] To reduce the risk of disrupting normal operations [[/C]]

[[Q]] What often happens during peak business periods like the holidays in retail companies? [[/Q]]
