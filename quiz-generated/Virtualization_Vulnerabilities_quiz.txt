[[Q]] What role does the hypervisor play in managing virtual machines? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It encrypts all file transfers [[/A]]
[[A]] It generates virtual machine user credentials [[/A]]
[[A]] It manages resource allocation between physical hardware and virtual machines [[/A]]
[[A]] It prevents software installations [[/A]]
[[A]] It backs up all VM data nightly [[/A]]

[[Q]] What is the concept of resource reuse in virtualization? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Sharing internet bandwidth among users [[/A]]
[[A]] Recycling deleted virtual machines [[/A]]
[[A]] Reassigning RAM or storage between VMs based on demand [[/A]]
[[A]] Using one password for all VMs [[/A]]
[[A]] Duplicating OS images for efficiency [[/A]]
[[C]] Reassigning RAM or storage between VMs based on demand [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why might multiple VMs appear to be allocated more RAM than is physically available? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The hypervisor inflates memory metrics [[/A]]
[[A]] Each VM has separate physical RAM [[/A]]
[[A]] The hypervisor allocates resources dynamically as needed [[/A]]
[[A]] RAM is split evenly regardless of actual use [[/A]]
[[A]] Memory duplication occurs by default [[/A]]
