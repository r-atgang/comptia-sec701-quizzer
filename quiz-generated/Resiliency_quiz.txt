[[A]] Server clustering requires more bandwidth than load balancing [[/A]]
[[A]] Load balancing requires all servers to use the same OS [[/A]]
[[A]] Server clustering allows servers to operate independently without shared storage [[/A]]
[[A]] Load-balanced servers are unaware of each other’s existence [[/A]]
[[A]] Server clustering involves fewer servers than load balancing [[/A]]
[[C]] Load-balanced servers are unaware of each other’s existence [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a hot site in disaster recovery planning? [[/Q]]
[[A]] A site with minimal infrastructure that must be set up during a disaster [[/A]]
[[A]] A data center with only power and lighting installed [[/A]]
[[A]] A duplicate of the primary data center with synchronized data and updated applications [[/A]]
[[A]] A location used only for storing paper-based records [[/A]]
[[A]] A backup system hosted by a cloud provider [[/A]]
[[C]] A duplicate of the primary data center with synchronized data and updated applications [[/C]]

[[Q]] What does a cold site typically lack during a disaster recovery situation? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Lighting and power [[/A]]
[[A]] Internet connectivity [[/A]]
[[A]] Any stored backups [[/A]]
[[A]] Equipment and personnel on-site [[/A]]
[[A]] Structural safety compliance [[/A]]
[[C]] Equipment and personnel on-site [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which of the following best describes a warm site? [[/Q]]
[[A]] A fully operational duplicate of the main data center [[/A]]
[[A]] A site that includes some equipment and some data, but requires additional setup [[/A]]
[[A]] An off-site location used only for data backups [[/A]]
[[A]] A remote desktop environment [[/A]]
[[A]] A mobile data center on standby [[/A]]
[[C]] A site that includes some equipment and some data, but requires additional setup [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is one challenge of having a geographically distant recovery site? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Increased risk of simultaneous regional disasters [[/A]]
[[A]] Higher chance of data corruption [[/A]]
[[A]] Difficulty transporting people and equipment during a disaster [[/A]]
[[A]] Inability to synchronize data [[/A]]
[[A]] More frequent service interruptions [[/A]]
[[C]] Difficulty transporting people and equipment during a disaster [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why is platform diversity considered a form of resiliency? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It allows different applications to run on different versions of the same OS [[/A]]
[[A]] It simplifies software licensing [[/A]]
[[A]] It ensures all systems are compatible with each other [[/A]]
[[A]] It reduces the risk of a single OS vulnerability affecting all systems [[/A]]
[[A]] It helps consolidate operating systems to reduce complexity [[/A]]
[[C]] It reduces the risk of a single OS vulnerability affecting all systems [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the advantage of using multiple cloud providers in a multi-cloud system? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It increases licensing fees [[/A]]
[[A]] It limits the types of applications that can be used [[/A]]
[[A]] It provides vendor lock-in benefits [[/A]]
[[A]] It offers increased availability and security if one provider has issues [[/A]]
[[A]] It simplifies network configurations [[/A]]
[[C]] It offers increased availability and security if one provider has issues [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the goal of Continuity Of Operations Planning (COOP)? [[/Q]]
[[A]] To completely avoid any form of disaster [[/A]]
[[A]] To rely solely on cloud-based recovery [[/A]]
[[A]] To implement manual processes to maintain services when technology fails [[/A]]
[[A]] To reduce hardware redundancy [[/A]]
[[A]] To monitor uptime statistics [[/A]]
[[C]] To implement manual processes to maintain services when technology fails [[/C]]

[[Q]] In a server clustering setup, why is shared storage typically used? [[/Q]]
[[A]] To isolate server failures from storage systems [[/A]]
[[A]] To store archived logs [[/A]]
[[A]] To allow each server to run different operating systems [[/A]]
[[A]] To ensure all servers access the same up-to-date data [[/A]]
[[A]] To simplify load balancing [[/A]]
[[C]] To ensure all servers access the same up-to-date data [[/C]]
