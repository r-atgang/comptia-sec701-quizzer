[[A]] They replace all VPN infrastructure [[/A]]
[[C]] They allow implicit trust based on location or department [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the role of the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) in a zero trust model? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It makes final decisions on traffic approval [[/A]]
[[A]] It stores encrypted authentication tokens [[/A]]
[[A]] It routes traffic without inspection [[/A]]
[[A]] It evaluates and forwards access requests to decision makers [[/A]]
[[A]] It authenticates users without context [[/A]]
[[C]] It evaluates and forwards access requests to decision makers [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which component is responsible for making the final decision to allow or deny access in zero trust? [[/Q]]

[[A]] It blocks all unknown traffic [[/A]]
[[A]] It sends access credentials to the Policy Enforcement Point [[/A]]
[[A]] It modifies firewall rules directly [[/A]]
[[C]] It sends access credentials to the Policy Enforcement Point [[/C]]

[[A]] Only full-time employees [[/A]]
[[A]] Only end-user devices [[/A]]
[[A]] Users, processes, and applications [[/A]]
[[A]] Only cloud-hosted services [[/A]]
[[A]] Only on-premises systems [[/A]]
[[C]] Users, processes, and applications [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why might a zero trust model restrict access to the network through limited entry points? [[/Q]]
