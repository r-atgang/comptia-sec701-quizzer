[[Q]] Why is ARP poisoning possible on a network? [[/Q]]
[[A]] ARP uses multi-factor authentication. [[/A]]
[[A]] ARP includes strong encryption. [[/A]]
[[A]] ARP lacks security and encryption mechanisms. [[/A]]
[[A]] ARP is only used over the internet. [[/A]]
[[A]] ARP packets are invisible to attackers. [[/A]]
[[C]] ARP lacks security and encryption mechanisms. [[/C]]

[[Q]] In ARP poisoning, what role does the attacker play? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They generate strong encryption keys. [[/A]]
[[A]] They delete router firmware. [[/A]]
[[A]] They physically disconnect devices. [[/A]]
[[A]] They intercept and forward communication between devices. [[/A]]
[[A]] They replace the IP addresses on the devices. [[/A]]
[[C]] They intercept and forward communication between devices. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What condition must be met for a traditional ARP poisoning attack to work? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The attacker must be on the same IP subnet. [[/A]]
[[A]] The attacker must have administrative access. [[/A]]
[[A]] The attacker must be using wireless communication. [[/A]]
[[A]] The victim must initiate a VPN connection. [[/A]]
[[A]] The attacker must know the Wi-Fi password. [[/A]]
[[C]] The attacker must be on the same IP subnet. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What happens when an ARP cache is poisoned? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The router switches off automatically. [[/A]]
[[A]] The correct IP address is blocked. [[/A]]
[[A]] Devices reroute traffic through the attacker. [[/A]]
[[A]] The device resets to factory defaults. [[/A]]
[[A]] DNS settings are modified. [[/A]]
[[C]] Devices reroute traffic through the attacker. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What allows the attacker to successfully update a deviceâ€™s ARP cache with their own MAC address? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The ARP protocol checks for duplicate addresses. [[/A]]
[[A]] Devices authenticate MAC addresses. [[/A]]
[[A]] ARP caches are encrypted. [[/A]]
[[A]] ARP accepts any response as valid. [[/A]]
[[A]] MAC addresses must be manually approved. [[/A]]
[[C]] ARP accepts any response as valid. [[/C]]

[[Q]] What distinguishes an on-path browser attack from traditional on-path attacks? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It targets only wireless devices. [[/A]]
[[A]] It works over the internet without malware. [[/A]]
[[A]] It occurs on the same device as the victim. [[/A]]
[[A]] It only affects cloud-based systems. [[/A]]
[[A]] It is prevented by antivirus software. [[/A]]
[[C]] It occurs on the same device as the victim. [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why is encrypted traffic still vulnerable to an on-path browser attack? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Encryption standards are outdated. [[/A]]
[[A]] The attack breaks SSL certificates. [[/A]]
[[A]] It decrypts traffic at the router level. [[/A]]
[[A]] The attack occurs before encryption is applied. [[/A]]
[[A]] It reroutes traffic outside the local network. [[/A]]
[[C]] The attack occurs before encryption is applied. [[/C]]

[[Q]] How does an on-path browser attack typically gain access to a system? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Through brute-force login attempts [[/A]]
[[A]] By exploiting weak Wi-Fi passwords [[/A]]
[[A]] Via malware or Trojan installation [[/A]]
[[A]] Through router firmware upgrades [[/A]]
[[A]] By manipulating DNS records [[/A]]
[[C]] Via malware or Trojan installation [[/C]]

[[Q]] What type of proxy is used in an on-path browser attack? [[/Q]]
[[A]] A reverse DNS proxy [[/A]]
[[A]] A local application-layer proxy [[/A]]
[[A]] A cloud-based anonymizer proxy [[/A]]
[[A]] A remote mail relay proxy [[/A]]
[[A]] A firewall tunneling proxy [[/A]]
[[C]] A local application-layer proxy [[/C]]

[[Q]] What type of sensitive information can be captured during an on-path browser attack? [[/Q]]
