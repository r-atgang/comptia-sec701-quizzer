[[Q]] What is a race condition in the context of application behavior? [[/Q]]
[[A]] A programming bug that causes applications to crash on startup [[/A]]
[[A]] A situation where multiple users access an application at the same time [[/A]]
[[A]] A scenario where two events happen simultaneously and the application doesn't properly account for it [[/A]]
[[A]] A hardware malfunction that causes inconsistent processing [[/A]]
[[A]] An error that only occurs when the application is under heavy network load [[/A]]
[[C]] A scenario where two events happen simultaneously and the application doesn't properly account for it [[/C]]

[[Q]] What does TOCTOU stand for in the context of race conditions? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Time of Code to Order of Use [[/A]]
[[A]] Time of Change to Time of Output [[/A]]
[[A]] Timing of Commands and Tracking of Output Units [[/A]]
[[A]] Time-Of-Check to Time-Of-Use [[/A]]
[[A]] Time-Of-Call to Time-Of-Upgrade [[/A]]
[[C]] Time-Of-Check to Time-Of-Use [[/C]]

[[Q]] In a TOCTOU attack, what happens between the check and use phases? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The application ignores the result of the check [[/A]]
[[A]] Another process may alter the data between the check and its use [[/A]]
[[A]] The application reboots itself [[/A]]
[[A]] The user is logged out due to timeout [[/A]]
[[A]] The system runs background updates [[/A]]
[[C]] Another process may alter the data between the check and its use [[/C]]

[[Q]] In the race condition example involving two users and two accounts, why did the final balance of Account A become incorrect? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Deposits were not reflected in the ledger [[/A]]
[[A]] The users withdrew money from different accounts [[/A]]
[[A]] The application crashed during the withdrawal process [[/A]]
[[A]] Withdrawals were not updated immediately for all users [[/A]]
[[A]] Only one user had permissions to access Account A [[/A]]
[[C]] Withdrawals were not updated immediately for all users [[/C]]

[[Q]] What was the unexpected result in the two-user account example? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Account B had more money than expected [[/A]]
[[A]] Account A was locked by the system [[/A]]
[[A]] Account A showed $50 when it should have shown $0 [[/A]]
[[A]] The application prevented all further transactions [[/A]]
[[A]] User 2 was unable to complete the withdrawal [[/A]]
[[C]] Account A showed $50 when it should have shown $0 [[/C]]

[[Q]] What caused the Mars rover Spirit to repeatedly reboot in 2004? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Power failure on the rover [[/A]]
[[A]] Incorrect temperature readings [[/A]]
[[A]] A TOCTOU race condition involving the rover’s file system [[/A]]
[[A]] A GPS malfunction due to solar interference [[/A]]
[[A]] A failed antenna deployment [[/A]]
[[C]] A TOCTOU race condition involving the rover’s file system [[/C]]

[[Q]] How was the Mars rover Spirit’s reboot loop eventually resolved? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Engineers shut the rover down remotely [[/A]]
[[A]] A reset button was triggered by onboard programming [[/A]]
[[A]] Solar flares corrected the malfunction [[/A]]
[[A]] Additional code was sent to bypass the error [[/A]]
[[A]] The rover moved to a different location [[/A]]
[[C]] Additional code was sent to bypass the error [[/C]]

[[Q]] What vulnerability did attackers exploit in the 2023 Pwn2Own Tesla Model 3 attack? [[/Q]]
[[A]] A flaw in the brake system software [[/A]]
[[A]] A timing issue in the autopilot module [[/A]]
[[A]] A Bluetooth vulnerability in the infotainment system [[/A]]
[[A]] A bug in the battery charging algorithm [[/A]]
[[A]] An authentication bypass in the navigation software [[/A]]
[[C]] A Bluetooth vulnerability in the infotainment system [[/C]]

[[Q]] What access did the attackers gain in the Tesla Model 3 TOCTOU attack? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Remote driving capability [[/A]]
[[A]] Access to vehicle GPS logs [[/A]]
[[A]] Elevated privileges as root user of the infotainment system [[/A]]
[[A]] The ability to disable airbags [[/A]]
[[A]] Control over battery management system [[/A]]
[[C]] Elevated privileges as root user of the infotainment system [[/C]]

[[Q]] What reward did the Tesla Model 3 attackers receive during Pwn2Own 2023? [[/Q]]
[[A]] A free vacation and a Model Y [[/A]]
[[A]] $50,000 and a trip to Tesla headquarters [[/A]]
[[A]] Full administrative access to Tesla's codebase [[/A]]
[[A]] $100,000 and the Tesla vehicle used in the test [[/A]]
[[A]] An extended bug bounty agreement [[/A]]
[[C]] $100,000 and the Tesla vehicle used in the test [[/C]]
