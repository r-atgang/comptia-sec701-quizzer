[[A]] To eliminate the need for physical security [[/A]]
[[A]] To allow systems to automatically patch themselves [[/A]]
[[A]] To ensure a continuous feedback loop for improvement [[/A]]
[[A]] To avoid logging any test activity [[/A]]
[[C]] To ensure a continuous feedback loop for improvement [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a known environment in penetration testing? [[/Q]]
[[A]] An environment with partial credentials and access logs [[/A]]
[[A]] A test where no prior knowledge is provided to the tester [[/A]]
[[A]] A simulation with fake systems and decoys [[/A]]
[[A]] A test with full disclosure of systems to be attacked [[/A]]
[[A]] A red team-only simulation environment [[/A]]
[[C]] A test with full disclosure of systems to be attacked [[/C]]

[[Q]] What best describes a partially known environment in pen testing? [[/Q]]
[[A]] No information is provided to the tester [[/A]]
[[A]] The tester is given outdated system details [[/A]]
[[A]] A mix of known and unknown information is provided [[/A]]
[[A]] Only firewall settings are shared with the tester [[/A]]
[[A]] The tester uses only passive methods [[/A]]
[[C]] A mix of known and unknown information is provided [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a blind test in penetration testing terminology? [[/Q]]
[[A]] When testers only perform physical security tests [[/A]]
[[A]] When only firewall configurations are tested [[/A]]
[[A]] When no prior system information is given to testers [[/A]]
[[A]] When internal users test their own systems [[/A]]
[[A]] When penetration testing is done using only known exploits [[/A]]
[[C]] When no prior system information is given to testers [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the purpose of reconnaissance in penetration testing? [[/Q]]
[[A]] To install malicious software on target systems [[/A]]
[[A]] To train employees in social engineering prevention [[/A]]
[[A]] To gather information about systems and infrastructure [[/A]]
[[A]] To encrypt all outbound network traffic [[/A]]
[[A]] To delete old vulnerabilities from the database [[/A]]
[[C]] To gather information about systems and infrastructure [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which of the following is an example of passive reconnaissance? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Performing an operating system fingerprint [[/A]]
[[A]] Running a port scan on a server [[/A]]
[[A]] Querying a DNS server [[/A]]
[[A]] Reading company details on a corporate website [[/A]]
[[A]] Conducting a ping sweep across a network [[/A]]
[[C]] Reading company details on a corporate website [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why is passive reconnaissance harder to trace? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It uses automated tools on the target network [[/A]]
[[A]] It leaves extensive logs on the company’s servers [[/A]]
[[A]] It doesn't interact directly with the target’s network [[/A]]
[[A]] It disables intrusion detection systems [[/A]]
[[A]] It performs fast scans that go unnoticed [[/A]]
[[C]] It doesn't interact directly with the target’s network [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which of the following would be considered active reconnaissance? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Dumpster diving [[/A]]
[[A]] Reading online forums [[/A]]
[[A]] Performing a ping scan [[/A]]
[[A]] Interviewing former employees [[/A]]
[[A]] Reviewing the company’s public financial reports [[/A]]
[[C]] Performing a ping scan [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a risk of active reconnaissance? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It slows down the attacker’s scanning tools [[/A]]
[[A]] It corrupts system logs [[/A]]
[[A]] It increases the system’s storage use [[/A]]
[[A]] It is easily detected and logged by security systems [[/A]]
[[A]] It causes physical damage to hardware [[/A]]
[[C]] It is easily detected and logged by security systems [[/C]]
