[[A]] FTP [[/A]]
[[A]] HTTP [[/A]]
[[A]] DNS [[/A]]

[[A]] IEEE 802.11ac [[/A]]
[[A]] IEEE 802.1X [[/A]]
[[A]] IEEE 802.15.4 [[/A]]
[[A]] IEEE 802.5 [[/A]]
[[C]] IEEE 802.1X [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is another term often used to refer to IEEE 802.1X? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Port Mirroring [[/A]]
[[A]] VLAN Tagging [[/A]]
[[A]] Network Address Translation [[/A]]
[[A]] Port-based Network Access Control (NAC) [[/A]]
[[A]] Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [[/A]]
[[C]] Port-based Network Access Control (NAC) [[/C]]

[[Q]] What are the three components typically involved in the 802.1X authentication process? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Server, switch, and router [[/A]]
[[A]] Supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server [[/A]]
[[A]] Firewall, gateway, and DNS server [[/A]]
[[A]] Modem, endpoint, and access point [[/A]]
[[A]] User, application, and network [[/A]]
[[C]] Supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server [[/C]]

[[Q]] In the 802.1X framework, what is the role of the supplicant? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It stores user credentials for the entire network [[/A]]
[[A]] It acts as a firewall between networks [[/A]]
[[A]] It provides wireless connectivity to clients [[/A]]
[[A]] It initiates authentication by sending credentials [[/A]]
[[A]] It logs authentication attempts [[/A]]
[[C]] It initiates authentication by sending credentials [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the function of the authenticator in the 802.1X authentication process? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It issues IP addresses to clients [[/A]]
[[A]] It processes user credentials locally [[/A]]
[[A]] It connects users to the internet directly [[/A]]
[[A]] It manages access by forwarding credentials to the authentication server [[/A]]
[[A]] It encrypts network data end-to-end [[/A]]
[[C]] It manages access by forwarding credentials to the authentication server [[/C]]

[[Q]] What happens when a supplicant initially connects to the network under 802.1X? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The authentication server immediately grants access [[/A]]
[[A]] The supplicant is redirected to a captive portal [[/A]]
[[A]] The authenticator blocks network access until authentication is complete [[/A]]
[[A]] The supplicant is given limited guest access [[/A]]
[[A]] The authenticator creates a VPN tunnel [[/A]]
[[C]] The authenticator blocks network access until authentication is complete [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which type of request does the authenticator send first during the authentication process? [[/Q]]
[[A]] DHCP Request [[/A]]
[[A]] ARP Request [[/A]]
[[A]] EAP Request [[/A]]
[[A]] HTTP Request [[/A]]
[[A]] LDAP Request [[/A]]
[[C]] EAP Request [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which of the following is NOT typically used as an authentication database with 802.1X? [[/Q]]
[[A]] RADIUS [[/A]]
[[A]] TACACS+ [[/A]]
[[A]] Kerberos [[/A]]
[[A]] LDAP [[/A]]
[[A]] SNMP [[/A]]
[[C]] SNMP [[/C]]
