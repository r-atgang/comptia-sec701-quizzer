[[Q]] Why are embedded IoT devices considered a security risk? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They require frequent user authentication [[/A]]
[[A]] They do not use standard internet protocols [[/A]]
[[A]] They often operate without user awareness and lack direct OS access [[/A]]
[[A]] They are only connected via wired networks [[/A]]
[[A]] They cannot be remotely monitored [[/A]]
[[C]] They often operate without user awareness and lack direct OS access [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is firmware in the context of hardware devices? [[/Q]]
[[A]] A virus scanner for IoT devices [[/A]]
[[A]] The graphical user interface for device setup [[/A]]
[[A]] A backup storage medium [[/A]]
[[A]] The operating system embedded within the hardware [[/A]]
[[A]] The network controller software [[/A]]
[[C]] The operating system embedded within the hardware [[/C]]

[[Q]] Who is typically responsible for updating firmware on IoT devices? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Internet Service Providers [[/A]]
[[A]] Network administrators [[/A]]
[[A]] Device manufacturers [[/A]]

[[Q]] What does an End of Life (EOL) notice indicate? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The device has been recalled for safety [[/A]]
[[A]] The device will no longer function [[/A]]
[[A]] The manufacturer will stop selling the product soon [[/A]]
[[A]] The device will be upgraded with new hardware [[/A]]
[[A]] The operating system has reached maximum capacity [[/A]]
[[C]] The manufacturer will stop selling the product soon [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why is End of Service Life (EOSL) more critical than EOL from a security perspective? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It marks the point when hardware failure is expected [[/A]]
[[A]] It means the product will be removed from shelves [[/A]]
[[A]] It indicates the last date users can return the product [[/A]]
[[A]] It signifies no more security updates will be provided [[/A]]
[[A]] It refers to the end of user training for the product [[/A]]
[[C]] It signifies no more security updates will be provided [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a common response for organizations using legacy systems at EOSL? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Disconnect all legacy systems immediately [[/A]]
[[A]] Replace legacy systems with consumer electronics [[/A]]
[[A]] Turn off network connectivity permanently [[/A]]
[[A]] Compare operational needs vs. security risks and apply mitigations [[/A]]
[[A]] Upgrade to mobile apps exclusively [[/A]]
[[C]] Compare operational needs vs. security risks and apply mitigations [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is one method to mitigate risks associated with legacy devices? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Restrict power supply to the device [[/A]]
[[A]] Use additional firewall rules and IPS signatures [[/A]]
[[A]] Replace internal cabling with fiber optics [[/A]]
[[A]] Reduce device temperature manually [[/A]]
[[A]] Encrypt the device firmware without changing configuration [[/A]]
[[C]] Use additional firewall rules and IPS signatures [[/C]]
