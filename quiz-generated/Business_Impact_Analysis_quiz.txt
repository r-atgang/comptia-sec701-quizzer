[[A]] Backing up data at the end of each business day [[/A]]
[[A]] Recording the total number of system reboots per year [[/A]]
[[C]] Setting a goal of restoring both the web and database servers within 4 hours [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is Recovery Point Objective (RPO) primarily concerned with? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The length of time a system can be offline [[/A]]
[[A]] The frequency of system backups [[/A]]
[[A]] The point in time to which data must be restored after an outage [[/A]]
[[A]] The number of users that can access the system simultaneously [[/A]]
[[A]] The amount of bandwidth needed for recovery [[/A]]
[[C]] The point in time to which data must be restored after an outage [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which example best reflects a Recovery Point Objective (RPO)? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Replacing a failed router within 2 hours [[/A]]
[[A]] Restoring at least 12 months of customer data from backups to consider the system operational [[/A]]
[[A]] Limiting data transfers to 5GB during recovery [[/A]]
[[A]] Restarting the server without restoring lost files [[/A]]
[[A]] Repairing the hardware before notifying users [[/A]]
[[C]] Restoring at least 12 months of customer data from backups to consider the system operational [[/C]]

[[Q]] What does Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) measure? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The time between two consecutive failures of a device [[/A]]
[[A]] The amount of data lost after a failure [[/A]]
[[A]] The average time it takes to resolve and fully repair a problem [[/A]]
[[A]] The number of backups stored on site [[/A]]
[[A]] The percentage of uptime in a year [[/A]]
[[C]] The average time it takes to resolve and fully repair a problem [[/C]]

[[Q]] What factors contribute to calculating the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Number of users, data speed, and cloud sync [[/A]]
[[A]] Licensing fees, internet downtime, and server brand [[/A]]
[[A]] Time to diagnose, obtain parts, install, and configure equipment [[/A]]
[[A]] Backup duration, security checks, and bandwidth usage [[/A]]
[[A]] Recovery location, file permissions, and DNS records [[/A]]
[[C]] Time to diagnose, obtain parts, install, and configure equipment [[/C]]

[[Q]] How can an organization reduce its Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Increase the time spent diagnosing issues [[/A]]
[[A]] Rely only on warranty support [[/A]]
[[A]] Delay equipment purchases until needed [[/A]]
[[A]] Invest in on-site spare equipment or fast replacement contracts [[/A]]
[[A]] Schedule repairs only during business hours [[/A]]
[[C]] Invest in on-site spare equipment or fast replacement contracts [[/C]]

[[Q]] What does Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) represent in system planning? [[/Q]]
[[A]] The maximum amount of data loss allowed [[/A]]
[[A]] The number of users that can simultaneously use a system [[/A]]
[[A]] The estimated operational time before the system fails again [[/A]]
[[A]] The total number of backups completed in a year [[/A]]
[[A]] The amount of time needed for disaster recovery [[/A]]
[[C]] The estimated operational time before the system fails again [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which source is commonly used to determine the MTBF of a piece of equipment? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Employee satisfaction reports [[/A]]
[[A]] Manufacturer predictions or historical performance data [[/A]]
[[A]] Internet bandwidth test results [[/A]]
[[A]] Antivirus logs [[/A]]
[[A]] Database access times [[/A]]
[[C]] Manufacturer predictions or historical performance data [[/C]]

[[Q]] How can you roughly calculate the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Divide the total repair time by number of failures [[/A]]
[[A]] Multiply number of users by system uptime [[/A]]
[[A]] Subtract total downtime from expected life span [[/A]]
[[A]] Divide total uptime by number of failures [[/A]]
[[A]] Count the number of reboots in a day [[/A]]
[[C]] Divide total uptime by number of failures [[/C]]
