[[Q]] What distinguishes a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) from a regular DoS? [[/Q]]
[[A]] DDoS attacks originate from a single device [[/A]]
[[A]] DDoS attacks are performed only by authorized users [[/A]]
[[A]] DDoS uses multiple devices from different locations [[/A]]
[[A]] DDoS does not impact system availability [[/A]]
[[A]] DDoS cannot be prevented by patching [[/A]]
[[C]] DDoS uses multiple devices from different locations [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is a botnet in the context of DDoS attacks? [[/Q]]
[[A]] A network of DNS resolvers [[/A]]
[[A]] A list of compromised websites [[/A]]
[[A]] A group of infected devices controlled by an attacker [[/A]]
[[A]] A command used to restart web servers [[/A]]
[[A]] A collection of secure cloud storage systems [[/A]]
[[C]] A group of infected devices controlled by an attacker [[/C]]

[[Q]] What made the Zeus botnet notable? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It was the first DDoS attack ever launched [[/A]]
[[A]] It was responsible for shutting down the global DNS [[/A]]
[[A]] It had control over more than 3.6 million computers [[/A]]
[[A]] It only targeted mobile networks [[/A]]
[[A]] It was developed by a government agency [[/A]]
[[C]] It had control over more than 3.6 million computers [[/C]]

[[Q]] Why is a DDoS attack considered an asymmetric threat? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It uses encryption to hide attack traffic [[/A]]
[[A]] It always requires internal access to the network [[/A]]
[[A]] Attackers use fewer resources than the victim but can still cause major damage [[/A]]
[[A]] The attacker must compromise physical hardware [[/A]]
[[A]] The traffic always originates from a single IP [[/A]]
[[C]] Attackers use fewer resources than the victim but can still cause major damage [[/C]]

[[Q]] What is the purpose of using amplification in DDoS attacks? [[/Q]]
[[A]] To test DNS server configuration [[/A]]
[[A]] To encrypt traffic between botnet devices [[/A]]
[[A]] To increase the size of attack traffic from a small input [[/A]]
[[A]] To reduce bandwidth usage during the attack [[/A]]
[[A]] To store backup responses from DNS servers [[/A]]
[[C]] To increase the size of attack traffic from a small input [[/C]]

[[Q]] Which protocols are commonly exploited for amplification attacks? [[/Q]]
[[A]] FTP and SSH [[/A]]
[[A]] SMTP and POP3 [[/A]]
[[A]] DNS, ICMP, and NTP [[/A]]
[[A]] HTTP and HTTPS [[/A]]
[[A]] Telnet and SNMPv3 [[/A]]
[[C]] DNS, ICMP, and NTP [[/C]]

[[Q]] In a DNS amplification attack, what is typically true about the size of the response? [[/Q]]
[[A]] It is smaller than the query [[/A]]
[[A]] It is equal in size to the query [[/A]]
[[A]] It is significantly larger than the query [[/A]]
[[A]] It is blocked by default on all routers [[/A]]
[[A]] It is unreadable due to encryption [[/A]]
[[C]] It is significantly larger than the query [[/C]]

[[Q]] What role do open DNS resolvers play in DNS amplification attacks? [[/Q]]
[[A]] They prevent the attack by rejecting all queries [[/A]]
[[A]] They forward all requests to firewalls [[/A]]
[[A]] They provide a way to encrypt all outgoing data [[/A]]
[[A]] They allow attackers to amplify and reflect traffic to a victim [[/A]]
[[A]] They automatically blacklist attacker IPs [[/A]]
[[C]] They allow attackers to amplify and reflect traffic to a victim [[/C]]

[[Q]] What step does the botnet controller take to initiate a DNS amplification attack? [[/Q]]
[[A]] Spoof a DNS server’s IP address to target itself [[/A]]
[[A]] Send a shutdown command to all botnet devices [[/A]]
[[A]] Send a spoofed query to open DNS resolvers targeting the victim’s IP [[/A]]
[[A]] Reboot all compromised machines [[/A]]
